                <p>Hello All! There is a lot when it comes to getting to know me, but with that being said I'll do my best to summarize. I have lived in a few different states throughout the west coast of the country but I was born and raised in Denver CO. I went to East High School in the heart of the city, not too far from downtown and the capitol building. I've always loved the area, so much so I bought a condo in the Cap Hill area of Denver about 8 months ago. After I finished high school I had my first attempt at college in Fort Collins at Colorado State University. Turns out it wasn't for me. But I did find a passion for MMA and cage fighting. From there that passion took me to Portland OR, and then ultimately Las Vegas as I made it on to different teams. I had the pleasure of training with many notable fighters, including Matt Lindland, Randy Couture, Ray Sefo, and Misha Tate (Misha actually gave me a bloody nose for hitting her too hard). From there I found myself moving back to Denver. After a few years of odd jobs and customer serivce jobs I worked my way up to being an interim Vice President of sales for Transamerica Life Insurance company. Long story short, I loved the culture, hated the job. After leaving that job I found this bootcamp and decided to follow another of my passions for coding.
